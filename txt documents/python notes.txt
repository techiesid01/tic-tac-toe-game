PYTHON ARRAY IN NUMPY :

there are six ways of creating array in numpy
they are as follows 
array()- it is mostly used method of creating an array in numpy ass well as in general
linspace()- it makes several numbers of parts of the range it takes parameter in three differnt parts in the brackets the start,the end 
 		and number of parts in which it has to be divided.
logspace()- it creates the array by dividing them into number of there parts it also takes three different parameters the start,the 
		and the number of parts in which the array is to be divided it does the logarithm of each value in the mentioned 
		range of elements
arange()- here also we have a range of elemnts to be printed it also takes parameters in three different parts the start,the end and
  		the number of elemnts it should skip.
zeroes()- it is a method used to cr4eate an array with only zeroes here the parameter is passed as how many
		 zeroes to be printed in the array
ones()- it is a method used to cr4eate an array with only ones here the parameter is passed as how many
		 ones to be printed in the array



matrix in numpy (two dimensional array)
SYNTAX:- arr = array([
			[1,2,3]
			[4,5,6]
                     ])
now we can prerform certain predefined functions on these 2-dimensional array.they are as follows::---
arr.ndim()- this will give the dimension of the array it returns an integer value
arr.shape()- this will give the number of rows and columns of the matrix
arr.dtype()- this will give the datatype of the elements of the array
arr.size()- this function returns the number of elemnts in the array
arr.flatten()- this will flatten or shrink the 2-d array into a 1-d array
